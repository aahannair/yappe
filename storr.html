	<p>Parents need to know that Always October, by prolific children's author Bruce Coville, is about two young friends -- Jacob Doolittle and Lily Harker -- who discover a parallel world of monsters and must rescue a baby. Narrated by the two kids (they alternate chapters), the novel is fundamentally all plot. Challenge follows challenge at a rapid pace, so dangerous situations are resolved fairly quickly, but the monsters -- many of which are huge, fanged, menacing creatures can be very frightening. In some parts of the book, Jacob and Lily have reason to believe that one or more of their friends has been killed or trapped by monsters. Coville creates an age-appropriate monster world, but some kids may find this book too scary, or at least too scary for bedtime.
